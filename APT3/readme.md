# Threat Profile: APT3 (Gothic Panda)

## 📌 APT Number
**APT3**

## 🧠 Threat Actor Name
**Gothic Panda** (also known as Buckeye, UPS Team, TG-0110)

## 📝 Description

APT3 is a China-based cyber espionage group attributed to the **Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS)**. Active since at least **2010**, APT3 has conducted sophisticated and targeted cyber operations against a broad range of sectors including aerospace, defense, telecommunications, and energy across **the U.S., Hong Kong, and other global targets**.

APT3 is particularly notable for:

- Early and **rapid adoption of zero-day vulnerabilities**, including exploitation of Flash and Internet Explorer.
- Deploying custom malware such as **SHOTPUT**, **DOWNTOWN**, **UPPERCUT**, and **SOGU**.
- High-level **Operational Security (OpSec)** and stealth tactics that reduce their visibility in traditional network monitoring.
- TTPs that closely align with **MITRE ATT&CK techniques** such as:
  - T1203: Exploitation for Client Execution
  - T1105: Ingress Tool Transfer
  - T1071.001: Application Layer Protocol: Web Protocols

APT3’s tools and infrastructure were eventually repurposed by other threat actors, such as the **“Buckeye” group**, after a suspected leak of NSA tools (possibly from the Shadow Brokers incident).

The group is considered one of the more advanced Chinese cyber espionage actors, demonstrating a blend of custom tool development and coordinated intelligence gathering.
